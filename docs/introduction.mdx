## Fundamentals

### REST

The Exchange Rate and Currency Conversion API, like all of Abstract's APIs such as the [VAT validation API](https://www.abstractapi.com/vat-validation-rates-api), is organized around REST. It is designed to use predictable, resource-oriented URL's and to use HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

### HTTPS

The Exchange Rate API requires all communications to be secured TLS 1.2 or greater.

### API Versions

All of Abstract's API are versioned. The Currency Exchange Rates API is on Version 1.

### API Key

Your API key is your unique authentication key to be used to access Abstract's Exchange Rate API. Note that each of Abstract's API has a unique API key, so you will need different keys to access the Exchange Rate and [IP Geolocation APIs](https://www.abstractapi.com/api/ip-geolocation-api), for example. To authenticate your requests, you will need to append your API key to the base URL.

### Base URL

```md
https://currency.abstractapi.com/v1/
```
