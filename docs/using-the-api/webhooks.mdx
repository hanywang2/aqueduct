title: "Webhooks"

1. Login to the [Aqueduct Dashboard](https://dashboard.tryaqueduct.com/#/login)
   and fetch/generate your API key from the
   [settings page](https://dashboard.tryaqueduct.com/#/login)
2. **Use the API to subscribe your webhook endpoint to relevant Aqueduct
   events.** The ones that for provisioning are “provisioning.start” and
   “provisioning.end”

You can use the `curl` request below, just make sure you properly substitute in
your API key, URL, and secret (tip: if you’re lazy, you can probably just use
the api key as the secret)

```bash
curl --location \
--request POST 'https://api.tryaqueduct.com/v1/webhookendpoints' \
--header 'Authorization: Api-Key <insert-api-key-here>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "url": "<insert-your-webhook-url-here>",
    "enabledEvents": ["provisioning_start", "provisioning_end"],
    "secret": "<insert-your-secret-here>"
}'
```

If you registered the webhook successfully, you should be able to see it in the
settings page:

For development purposes, we suggest you use ngrok. One helpful feature that
ngrok has is the ability to replay any incoming request - so for example, if you
discover a bug in handling a particular webhook, you can just keep replaying
that one problematic request over and over in ngrok, without needing to create a
new invoice on the Aqueduct dashboard.

3. **Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint in your backend.** When an
   event you are monitoring is triggered, Aqueduct will call this endpoint as a
   POST request and deliver the data as a JSON payload.
4. **Trigger a test webhook request to test the integration.** You can do this
   on the Settings page by clicking the “send test event” button next to your
   webhook
5. **Trigger a provisioning webhook.** You can do this by using any
   [Invoice template](https://dashboard.tryaqueduct.com/#/contract-templates) to
   create an invoice, and setting the `effective date` to today. Once the
   invoice is created, a provisioning webhook will immediately fire. the payload
   will look like:

```json
// The provisioning object
{
  "productId": ProductId
  "customerId": CustomerId
  "startDate": Date // When the provisioning.start webhook is triggered
  "endDate": Date // When the provisioning.end webhook is triggered
  "invoiceId": InvoiceId | null
  "subscriptionId": SubscriptionId | null // Aqueduct subscription
  "metadata": object // Hashmap to pass through extra fields
    "customerId": CustomerId,
  "externalSubscriptionId": object | null // External subscription id
  "provisioningOrgs": {
        name: string,
        users: { name: string, email: string }[]
  }[]

    // Start and end dates are computed from these
    "contractStartDate": Date // Service period start that the user is paying for
    "contractEndDate": Date // Service period that the user is paying for
    "gracePeriodEndDate": Date // End of the grace period
    // We can also add managing trials if that's interesting to replit
}
```

6. **Implement logic handling the webhook in your backend.** Once you receive
   the payload, you can run whatever logic is suitable for you app. For example,
   you want want to provision your customer's access to your product after the
   product is mark as paid. Please a 2xx respond status code before running any
   complex logic so the request doesn't time out.

Aqueduct will retry events up to 4 times for 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx response codes
with a 1 hour, 6hr, 12hr, and 24hr delay. After all 4 events are attempted, we
will email you about the failure and stop attempting this webhook. You can go
back into the dashboard to turn on disabled webhooks.
