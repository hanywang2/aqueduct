title: "Idempotency"
---

The Aqueduct API supports
[idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) to ensure it is safe to
retry requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This
means that it’s always safe to retry a request if you’re unsure that it went
through - as long as you supply the same idempotency key.

There are two ways to perform idempotent requests:

**On an API request**

To perform an idempotent request, provide an `Idempotency-Key: <key>` HTTP
header to any POST request. Aqueduct will save the resulting response code and
body of the fully executed request made for an idempotency key. Any subsequent
requests with the same idempotency key do not execute and instead return the
same result.

GET and DELETE requests do not need an idempotency key as they are always
idempotent.

Idempotency keys can be any unique string. We suggest that you use a `UUID`
library in your programming language of choice. Note that we occasionally prune
our idempotency key cache, but we guarantee that each idempotency key will live
for at least 24 hours.

**On billable events**

We support idempotency on each BillableEvent resource. This is useful in case
you decide to send multiple BillableEvents in a single request. You can supply
an idempotencyKey for each BillableEvent, and Aqueduct will ensure that
BillableEvents are not double-counted.
