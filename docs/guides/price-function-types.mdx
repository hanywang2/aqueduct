title: "Price Function Types"

Price functions types Aqueduct supports different types of price functions.
These can be used individually or combined to express more complex business
models in a price model. You can create price models using the API or the
Aqueduct dashboard.

**Variables** for a price function can either be fixed, or "allow dynamic
values", which allows you to set new values at subscription creation time, along
with minimum/maximum boundaries, instead of fixing the variable values at price
model creation time.

## Per-unit

<Param path="unitCount" type="number" required />

<Param path="rate" type="number" required />

### Billing Calculation

`total = unitCount * rate`

This function supports prorations. A $30 a month plan that starts halfway
through the month and is billed at the end of the month would be charged $15 the
first month.

### Examples

per-unit functions can be used to bill a monthly subscription at $10 per seat
for 5 seats.

Variables for this example:

```md
unitCount: 5

rate: $10.00

billingFrequency: monthly
```

## Percentage

<Param path="amount" type="number" required>
  Output of another price function.
</Param>

<Param path="percent" type="number" required />

### Billing Calculation

`total = amount * percent`

This function can use a specified amount or the output for other pricing
functions.

### Examples

Percent functions can be used to represent a 50% discount on the first month

Variables for this example:

amount: Sum of all other price functions. percent: 50

## Tiered-per-unit-meter

<Param path="meter" type="string" required>
  Refers to the event name that you're using for this meter.
</Param>

<Param path="tiers" type="list of objects" required>
<Expandable title="object properties">
    <Param path="tierCutoff" type="number" required/>
    <Param path="rate" type="number" required/>
</Expandable>

</Param>

Billable event associated with this meter are:

```json
{
    eventName: string,
    customerId: string,
    data: {
        count: number
    }
}
```

### Billing Calculation

Sums the numbers of events that falls under each tier by that tier's rate.

For example: 90 events with tier<br/> 0-25 = $5<br/> 25-50 = $4<br/> 50-100 =
$3<br/>

25 5 = 125 (for 0-25 events)<br/> 25 4 = 100 (for 26-50 events)<br/> 40 \* 3 =
120 (for 51-90)<br/>

Total = $225 (from adding up all tiers 125 + 100 + 120)

### Examples

Per unit meter is used to represent a service provider that charges $100 per
hour and provided 20 hours of work.

Variables for this example:

```json
{
    meter: hourly_work_cody,
    tiers: {
        rate: $100
    },
    eventName: hourly_work_code (the event name and meter name must match),
    data: {
        count: 20
    }
}
```
